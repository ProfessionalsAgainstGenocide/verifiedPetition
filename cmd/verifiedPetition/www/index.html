    <h1>Professionals against genocide</h1>
    <p>By signing this petition, you endorse the following message</p>
    <p>As a member of the organization for which I work, I am signing this petition to express my opposition
        to doing business with the state of Israel.
        The state of Israel has been illegally and brutally occupying the Palestinian territories for over 50 years,
        with complete disregard to international humanitarian law and human rights. It has been deemed an apartheid
        state by <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2022/02/israels-system-of-apartheid/">Amnesty
            International</a>,
        <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution">Human
            Rights Watch</a>,
        <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/03/israels-55-year-occupation-palestinian-territory-apartheid-un-human-rights">UN
            experts</a>,
        and Israel's own human rights organization <a href="https://www.btselem.org/topic/apartheid">B'Tselem</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Without committing to fight apartheid, our leaders show a clear double standard in their commitment to human
        rights
        and international law, and lose credibility in their commitment to social justice.
    </p>
    <p>If the Palestinian people cannot boycott, cannot prosecute, and continue to get ignored, we can never expect
        security
        for Palestinians and Israelis alike.</p>
    <p>In the name of Gaza's children, and our children that will grow up and ask us what we did in the face of
        genocide,
        we request that the organizations we work for divest from the state of Israel until it changes course and gives
        Palestinians their own state, equal rights to Palestinian-Israeli citizens, roll back settlement in the West
        Bank,
        and lift the siege from Gaza.</p>

    <p><i>What happens when I enter my email here?</i></p>
    <p>When you enter your email, you'll receive an email message with a unique link.
        When the link is clicked, your signature is added to our database.</p>
    <p>Only emails from the domains
        <a href="https://github.com/TechForPalestine/verifiedPetition/blob/main/cmd/verifiedPetition/data/allowed_email_domains.txt">
            in this list</a> will be accepted.
    </p>
    <p>If your organization's domain is not part of the list, please open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/TechForPalestine/verifiedPetition">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p><i>Is my identity protected?</i></p>
    <p>We can only protect our own data and infrastructure. When you chose to receive this email to your corporate
        email, you accept the risk of that email being found by your IT department.</p>
    <p>When you choose to anonymize your email, we will hash/scramble your email in our database instead of
        using the actual email. While this does provide some protection, in the case of a breach, hashed emails can be brute-forced.</p>
    <p><i>What will my signature do?</i></p>
    <p>The <a href="/stats.html">stats page</a> shows the number of signatures per-domain.
    Once a significant number of signatories at an organization has been reached, we will contact representatives
    of the organization and inform them of the stance of their staff. We will also simultaneously
    contact non-anonymized signatories to let them know we've contacted their organization.</p>
    <p>This is the extent of the action, and we hope it serves as a wake-up call to executive leadership
    across industries.</p>
